//! Run — a single execution handle (event stream + control plane).
//!
//! `Run` is a one-shot consumer: call `next()` to read events.
//! For control (steer / follow_up / abort), use `handle()` to get
//! a cloneable `RunControl`.
//!
//! Internally a Run may span multiple engine turns (auto-continuation
//! while the run is active). `RunControl` survives engine swaps
//! between turns; consumers see a single stable handle.
